Understanding the Threat and How to Protect Yourself
Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal details. This is usually done by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications, such as emails or websites. Phishing attacks can lead to serious security breaches, financial losses, and identity theft.

How Phishing Works

Phishers typically send fraudulent emails or create fake websites that closely resemble those of legitimate organizations. These emails often contain links to fake websites or attachments that, when clicked, can install malware on your device or lead you to a malicious site where your information can be stolen.

For example, an attacker might send an email that appears to be from GitHub, asking you to verify your account or reset your password. If you click the link and enter your login details on the fake GitHub page, the attacker can then use that information to gain unauthorized access to your account.

How to Recognize and Avoid Phishing Attacks

Check the Sender's Email: Always verify the sender’s email address. Phishing emails often come from addresses that look similar to official ones but have slight differences.

Hover Over Links: Before clicking on any link, hover over it to see the actual URL. If it doesn’t match the legitimate site or looks suspicious, don’t click it.

Look for Typos and Errors: Phishing emails often contain spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or unusual formatting. Official communications from companies like GitHub are usually well-written and free of such errors.

Be Wary of Urgent Requests: Phishers often create a sense of urgency, claiming your account will be suspended or compromised if you don’t act immediately. Legitimate companies will not pressure you into making quick decisions.

Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on your GitHub account to add an extra layer of security. Even if your password is compromised, 2FA can prevent unauthorized access.

Report Phishing Attempts: If you suspect an email or website is a phishing attempt, report it to the appropriate authorities or the company being impersonated.

By staying vigilant and following these tips, you can protect yourself from phishing attacks and keep your online accounts secure.
